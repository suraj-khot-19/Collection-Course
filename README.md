## Java Collections Practice ðŸš€  

This repository contains my practice exercises and notes from a YouTube course on **Java Collections**. I have covered core concepts such as Map, List, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap, and Garbage Collection, along with various implementations and use cases.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered  
The following core Java collection concepts have been explored in depth:  
- âœ… **List** (ArrayList, LinkedList)  
- âœ… **Map** (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap)  
- âœ… **Concurrent Collections** (ConcurrentHashMap)  
- âœ… **Set** (HashSet, TreeSet)  
- âœ… **Queue** (PriorityQueue, LinkedList)  
- âœ… **Garbage Collection**  
- âœ… **Collection Framework Overview**  
- âœ… **Iterator and ListIterator**  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  
Each topic has its own Java file, demonstrating different aspects and examples.
