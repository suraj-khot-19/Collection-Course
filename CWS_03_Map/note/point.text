You're correct that `Map` is not included in the `Collection` interface in Java. The reason for this is the fundamental difference in the way `Map` works compared to other classes in the `Collection` framework. Here's a detailed explanation:

 Key Differences
1. Conceptual Difference:
   - `Collection`: Represents a group of objects, also known as elements, and provides standard operations like iteration, addition, and removal.
   - `Map`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and each key maps to exactly one value.

2. Hierarchy:
   - `Collection` is the root interface of all individual objects in a group (like `List`, `Set`, `Queue`).
   - `Map` is a separate interface in the `java.util` package and does not extend `Collection`.

3. Data Structure:
   - In `Collection` (e.g., `List` and `Set`), data is stored as individual elements.
   - In `Map`, data is stored as pairs (`key, value`), and the structure focuses on key-based lookup.

 Why `Map` Is Not Part of `Collection`?
1. Functional Requirements:
   - The methods in `Collection` like `add()`, `remove()`, and `contains()` are designed for elements. These operations don't align with the key-value pair nature of `Map`.

2. Ambiguity in Operations:
   - For example, what would `add()` mean in the context of a `Map`? Would it add a key-value pair, or just a key? This ambiguity makes it unsuitable for `Map` to be part of `Collection`.

3. Different Focus:
   - The `Map` interface focuses on efficient key-based access to values, which is not the primary focus of the `Collection` framework.

 How `Map` Fits in the Java Framework
Although `Map` is not part of the `Collection` interface, it is still a part of the Java Collection Framework (JCF) as a separate interface. It plays a critical role alongside other data structures like `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`.

 Related Interfaces and Classes
- `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `WeakHashMap`, and `ConcurrentHashMap` are popular implementations of `Map`.
- The `Map` interface has methods such as `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`, `keySet()`, `values()`, and `entrySet()` to work with key-value pairs.
