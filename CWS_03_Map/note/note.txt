Here are some common Java Map interview questions with their answers:

---

 1. What is a Map in Java?
Answer:  
A `Map` in Java is a collection interface that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique. It allows fast retrieval, update, and deletion of data using keys. Common implementations include `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `TreeMap`.

---

 2. What are the main implementations of the Map interface in Java?  
Answer:  
- HashMap: Unordered and unsorted; allows one null key and multiple null values.  
- LinkedHashMap: Maintains insertion order.  
- TreeMap: Sorted in natural order or by a custom comparator.  
- Hashtable: Synchronized version of HashMap, doesn't allow null keys or values.  
- ConcurrentHashMap: Thread-safe version of HashMap.

 3. What is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable?  
Answer:  
| Feature         | HashMap                   | Hashtable                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Thread Safety    | Not thread-safe              | Thread-safe                 |
| Null Keys/Values | Allows one null key and multiple null values | Does not allow null keys or values |
| Performance      | Faster (no synchronization overhead) | Slower due to synchronization |
| Usage            | Preferred in single-threaded environments | Used in multi-threaded environments |

 4. How does HashMap work internally?  
Answer:  
- HashMap uses an array of buckets to store data.  
- The hash code of the key determines the bucket where the key-value pair will be stored.  
- If multiple keys result in the same hash code, a linked list (or tree in case of collisions) is used in the bucket to store entries.  
- From Java 8 onwards, if the number of entries in a bucket exceeds a threshold (default 8), the linked list is converted to a balanced tree for better performance.

 5. What is the load factor in HashMap?  
Answer:  
- The load factor determines when the HashMap will resize (increase capacity).  
- Default load factor is 0.75, meaning the HashMap will resize when 75% of its capacity is filled.  
- Resizing involves doubling the capacity and rehashing the entries.

 6. What is the difference between TreeMap and HashMap?  
Answer:  
| Feature         | HashMap                | TreeMap                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Order           | No order maintained       | Sorted (natural or custom order) |
| Null Keys       | Allows one null key       | Does not allow null keys     |
| Performance     | O(1) for get/put operations | O(log n) for get/put operations |
| Usage           | Use when order doesnâ€™t matter | Use when sorted order is required |

 7. How to iterate over a Map in Java?
Answer:  
You can iterate over a Map using:
- Entry Set:
  ```java
  for (Map.Entry<K, V> entry : map.entrySet()) {
      System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey() + ", Value: " + entry.getValue());
  }
  ```
- Key Set:
  ```java
  for (K key : map.keySet()) {
      System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + map.get(key));
  }
  ```
- Java 8 forEach:
  ```java
  map.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + value));
  ```

 8. What happens if two keys have the same hash code in HashMap?
Answer:  
When two keys have the same hash code (hash collision):
- They are placed in the same bucket.
- A linked list is used to store these entries.
- The `equals` method is used to differentiate between the keys.  

From Java 8 onwards, the linked list is converted into a balanced tree if the number of elements in the bucket exceeds the threshold.

---

 9. How does ConcurrentHashMap differ from HashMap?
Answer:  
- ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe and allows concurrent reads and writes without locking the entire map.  
- Instead of locking the entire Map, it uses a concept of segments for better concurrency.  
- Null keys and values are not allowed in `ConcurrentHashMap`.

---

 10. Can a HashMap key be mutable?
Answer:  
No, using a mutable object as a key in a `HashMap` is discouraged because:
- If the key's state changes after being added to the map, its hash code may change, making it impossible to retrieve the entry correctly.

---

 11. What are WeakHashMap and IdentityHashMap?
Answer:  
- WeakHashMap:  
  Uses weak references for keys. If a key is no longer in use, it will be garbage collected.  
- IdentityHashMap:  
  Compares keys using `==` instead of `equals`.
